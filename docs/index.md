## Summary
Elate is an app created to help lift the user's current state of mind and help them through an offered action, or advice in order to make them feel better.
At any given moment the user can check in on the app and enter their current state of mind. According to which state of mind is entered the app then recommends a first immediate action to take in order to help elevate the user's mood.
The app then give the users a first option which they can either accept and complete. Once the acton is completed the user is asked again to rate their current state of mind. If they do not feel better or if they choose to, the same logic is then applied.
The user can also decide that the first recommended action doesn't appeal to them,and they can automatically get an alternate advice.
Once the process is done and the user is satisfied., they get the opportunity if they feel like it to enter their thoughts in a reflection box.

## Persistent data

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the Android device. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use. 
    
## Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
